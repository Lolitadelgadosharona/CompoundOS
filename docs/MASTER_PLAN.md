# Master Plan

## Long-term Goal

Build CompoundOS as a trustworthy, explainable operating system for family office and wealth management workflows, beginning with a documented and testable foundation.

## Milestones

- Milestone 1: Foundation and governance scaffold
- Milestone 2: Core platform services and health monitoring
- Milestone 3: Decision support workflows and review interfaces

## Current Sprint

- Sprint 001: Project Foundation
- Status: Done
- Scope: final foundation verification, frontend health test, and Docker-based
  local development configuration
- Sprint 002: Not Started; implementation has not been authorized

## Planning

- Sprint 002 selected direction: Household Investment Policy + Decision Journal.
- Planning pull request #4 is Draft and under review.
- Sprint 002 implementation is Not Started and requires explicit approval after
  the planning pull request merges.

## Backlog

- Complete Docker runtime verification in a Docker-enabled environment
- Decide whether to migrate `frontend/` to `apps/web/`
- Add backend domain modules
- Introduce data persistence and orchestration
- Add Guardian monitoring workflows
- Add AI Investment Committee workflows
- Add notification escalation capabilities

## In Progress

- None

## Review

- Planning PR #4 independent review result: REQUEST CHANGES — Documentation only.
- Planning revisions cover lifecycle semantics, the single-household constraint,
  localhost-only bindings, PostgreSQL integration testing, provisional disclaimer,
  local retention boundary, and Definition of Done.

## Decision Log

- 2026-07-11: Use a minimal monorepo with FastAPI and Next.js placeholders for Sprint 001.
- 2026-07-11: Avoid implementing investment logic, trading, brokers, or autonomous agents in this sprint.
- 2026-07-11: Defer Docker Compose until it can be validated in a Docker-enabled environment.
- 2026-07-12: Isolate CompoundOS in a dedicated repository directory while preserving Sprint 001 history.
- 2026-07-12: Standardize on Node.js 22, npm 10, TypeScript, and Next.js 16.2.10.
- 2026-07-12: Retain `frontend/` alongside `apps/api/` for Sprint 001.1; evaluate `apps/web/` later.
- 2026-07-12: Complete Sprint 001.1 after local validation and GitHub Actions passed.
- 2026-07-12: Finalize Sprint 001 and Sprint 001.1 through pull request #1 using a
  squash merge (`b3801c64fa09856d491317b0ebda45007c210ae0`).
- 2026-07-12: Keep Sprint 002 Not Started; the next approved action is planning only.
- 2026-07-12: Reopen Sprint 001 in Review to add the approved Docker development
  configuration and frontend health test without beginning Sprint 002.

  APPROVE WITH NON-BLOCKING FOLLOW-UP.
- 2026-07-12: Treat Docker runtime verification as a non-blocking follow-up and
  retain it in the Backlog.
