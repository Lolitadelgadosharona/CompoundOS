# Master Plan

## Long-term Goal

Build CompoundOS as a trustworthy, explainable operating system for family office and wealth management workflows, beginning with a documented and testable foundation.

## Milestones

- Milestone 1: Foundation and governance scaffold
- Milestone 2: Core platform services and health monitoring
- Milestone 3: Decision support workflows and review interfaces

## Current Sprint

- Sprint 001.1: Repository Hardening
- Status: Review
- Scope: repository isolation, Git delivery readiness, dependency consistency,
  architecture decisions, and validation

## Backlog

- Add and validate Docker-based local development configuration
- Decide whether to migrate `frontend/` to `apps/web/`
- Add backend domain modules
- Introduce data persistence and orchestration
- Add Guardian monitoring workflows
- Add AI Investment Committee workflows
- Add notification escalation capabilities

## In Progress

- Push the hardening branch and prepare a draft pull request
- Confirm GitHub Actions results

## Review

- Sprint 001.1 implementation and validation results
- Git identity correction
- GitHub remote, pull request, and CI status

## Done

- Repository structure created
- Basic health endpoints implemented
- Initial documentation scaffold added
- Backend and frontend validation commands added
- Production frontend dependency audit completed with no known vulnerabilities
- CompoundOS repository isolated from unrelated parent-directory files
- npm, Node.js, TypeScript, and Next.js version decisions documented
- ADR 0001 accepted for the frontend framework and package manager
- Sprint 001 Git identity corrected using the approved repository-local identity
- Intended empty GitHub repository verified

## Decision Log

- 2026-07-11: Use a minimal monorepo with FastAPI and Next.js placeholders for Sprint 001.
- 2026-07-11: Avoid implementing investment logic, trading, brokers, or autonomous agents in this sprint.
- 2026-07-11: Defer Docker Compose until it can be validated in a Docker-enabled environment.
- 2026-07-12: Isolate CompoundOS in a dedicated repository directory while preserving Sprint 001 history.
- 2026-07-12: Standardize on Node.js 22, npm 10, TypeScript, and Next.js 16.2.10.
- 2026-07-12: Retain `frontend/` alongside `apps/api/` for Sprint 001.1; evaluate `apps/web/` later.
